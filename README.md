# Plurality Voting System
 
This program implements a simple plurality voting system in C. It allows users to input a list of candidates and cast votes. The program then determines and displays the winner(s) based on the highest number of votes.

### Usage
Compile the program using a C compiler. Execute it with the list of candidates as command-line arguments. The user will be prompted to enter the number of voters and cast their votes accordingly.


./plurality candidate1 candidate2 candidate3

### Input
The program takes the list of candidates and the number of voters as input. Voters are prompted to enter their votes, and the system checks for valid votes.

### Output
The program outputs the winner(s) of the election based on the highest number of votes.

#### Note
The maximum number of candidates is limited to 9.
In case of ties, all candidates with the highest vote count are declared winners.

Feel free to customize and enhance the program as needed!
